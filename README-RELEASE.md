# How to make a new release (maintainer info)

## Release schedule

The xPack CMake release schedule generally follows the original GitHub
[releases](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases), but with a
three weeks filter, which means that releases that are overriden in
three weeks are skipped. Also initial x.y.0 releases are skipped.

## Prepare the build

Before starting the build, perform some checks and tweaks.

### Check Git

- switch to the `xpack-develop` branch
- if needed, merge the `xpack` branch

### Increase the version

Determine the version (like `3.19.1`) and update the `scripts/VERSION`
file; the format is `3.19.1-1`. The fourth number is the xPack release number
of this version. A fifth number will be added when publishing
the package on the `npm` server.

### Fix possible open issues

Check GitHub issues and pull requests:

- https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/issues

and fix them; assign them to a milestone (like `3.19.1-1`).

### Check `README.md`

Normally `README.md` should not need changes, but better check.
Information related to the new version should not be included here,
but in the version specific file (below).

- update version in README-RELEASE.md
- update version in README-BUILD.md

## Update `CHANGELOG.md`

- open the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- check if all previous fixed issues are in
- add a new entry like _v3.19.1-1 prepared_
- commit commit with a message like _CHANGELOG: prepare v3.19.1-1_

Note: if you missed to update the `CHANGELOG.md` before starting the build,
edit the file and rerun the build, it should take only a few minutes to
recreate the archives with the correct file.

### Update the version specific code

- open the `common-versions-source.sh` file
- add a new `if` with the new version before the existing code

### Update helper

With Sourcetree, go to the helper repo and update to the latest master commit.

## Build

### Development run the build scripts

Before the real build, run a test build on the development machine (`wks`):

```sh
sudo rm -rf ~/Work/cmake-*

caffeinate bash ~/Downloads/cmake-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --develop --without-pdf --disable-tests --linux64 --win64 --linux32 --win32
```

Work on the scripts until all 4 platforms pass the build.

## Push the build script

In this Git repo:

- push the `xpack-develop` branch to GitHub
- possibly push the helper project too

From here it'll be cloned on the production machines.

### Run the build scripts

On the macOS machine (`xbbm`) open ssh sessions to both Linux machines
(`xbbi` and `xbba`):

```sh
caffeinate ssh xbbi

caffeinate ssh xbba
```

On all machines, clone the `xpack-develop` branch:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Downloads/cmake-xpack.git; \
git clone \
  --recurse-submodules \
  --branch xpack-develop \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack.git \
  ~/Downloads/cmake-xpack.git
```

On all machines, remove any previous build:

```sh
sudo rm -rf ~/Work/cmake-*
```

Empty trash.

On the macOS machine (`xbbm`):

```sh
caffeinate bash ~/Downloads/cmake-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --osx
```

A typical run takes about 10 minutes.

On both Linux machines (`xbbi` and `xbba`):

```sh
bash ~/Downloads/cmake-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --all
```

A typical run on the Intel machine takes about 25 minutes;
on the Arm machine it takes about 60 minutes.

### Clean the destination folder

On the development machine (`wks`) clear the folder where binaries from all
build machines will be collected.

```sh
rm -f ~/Downloads/xpack-binaries/cmake/*
```

### Copy the binaries to the development machine

On all three machines:

```sh
(cd ~/Work/cmake-*/deploy; scp * ilg@wks:Downloads/xpack-binaries/cmake)
```

## Testing

Install the binaries on all supported platforms and check if they are
functional.

## Create a new GitHub pre-release

- in `CHANGELOG.md`, add release date
- commit and push the `xpack-develop` branch
- go to the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/releases) page
- click **Draft a new release**, in the `xpack-develop` branch
- name the tag like **v3.19.1-1** (mind the dash in the middle!)
- name the release like **xPack CMake v3.19.1-1**
(mind the dash)
- as description
  - add a downloads badge like `![Github Releases (by Release)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/v3.19.1-1/total.svg)`
  - draft a short paragraph explaining what are the main changes, like
  _Version v3.19.1-1 is a new release of the **xPack CMake** package, following the CMake release._
  - add _At this moment these binaries are provided for tests only!_
- **attach binaries** and SHA (drag and drop from the archives folder will do it)
- **enable** the **pre-release** button
- click the **Publish Release** button

Note: at this moment the system should send a notification to all clients
watching this project.

## Run the release Travis tests

Using the scripts in `tests/scripts/`, start:

- `trigger-travis-quick.mac.command` (optional)
- `trigger-travis-stable.mac.command`
- `trigger-travis-latest.mac.command`

The test results are available from:

- https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack

For more details, see `tests/scripts/README.md`.

## Prepare a new blog post

In the `xpack/web-jekyll` GitHub repo:

- select the `develop` branch
- add a new file to `_posts/cmake/releases`
- name the file like `2020-07-03-cmake-v3-18-5-1-released.md`
- name the post like: **xPack CMake v3.19.1-1 released**
- as `download_url` use the tagged URL like `https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/releases/tag/v3.19.1-1/`
- update the `date:` field with the current date
- update the Travis URLs using the actual test pages
- update the SHA sums via copy/paste from the original build machines
(it is very important to use the originals!)

If any, refer to closed
[issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/issues)
as:

- **[Issue:\[#1\]\(...\)]**.

### Update the SHA sums

On the development machine (`wks`):

```sh
cat ~/Downloads/xpack-binaries/cmake/*.sha
```

Copy/paste the build report at the end of the post as:

```console
## Checksums
The SHA-256 hashes for the files are:

## Update the preview Web

- commit the `develop` branch of `xpack/web-jekyll` GitHub repo;
  use a message like **xPack CMake v3.19.1-1 released**
- wait for the GitHub Pages build to complete
- the preview web is https://xpack.github.io/web-preview/

## Update package.json binaries

- select the `xpack-develop`Â branch
- open the `package.json` file
- run `xpm-dev binaries-update`

```
xpm-js.git/bin/xpm-dev.js binaries-update '3.19.1-1' "${HOME}/Downloads/xpack-binaries/cmake"
```

- open the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/releases)
  page and select the latest release
- check the download counter, it should match the number of tests
- check the `baseUrl:` it should match the file URLs (including the tag/version);
  no terminating `/` is required
- from the release, check the SHA & file names
- compare the SHA sums with those shown by `cat *.sha`
- check the executable names
- commit all changes, use a message like
  `package.json: update urls for 3.19.1-1.1 release` (without `v`)

## Publish on the npmjs.com server

- check the latest commits `npm run git-log`
- update `CHANGELOG.md`; commit with a message like
  _CHANGELOG: prepare npm v3.19.1-1.1_
- `npm version 3.19.1-1.1`; the first 5 numbers are the same as the
  GitHub release; the sixth number is the npm specific version
- `npm pack` and check the content of the archive, which should list
  only the `package.json`, the `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- push the `xpack-develop` branch to GitHub
- `npm publish --tag next` (use `--access public` when publishing for
  the first time)

The version is visible at:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/cmake?activeTab=versions

## Test if the npm binaries can be installed with xpm

Run the `tests/scripts/trigger-travis-xpm-install.sh` script, this
will install the package on Intel Linux 64-bit, macOS and Windows 64-bit.

The test results are available from:

- https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack

For 32-bit Windows, 32-bit Intel GNU/Linux and 32-bit Arm, install manually.

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/cmake@next
```

## Test the npm binaries

Install the binaries on all platforms.

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/cmake@next
```

On GNU/Linux systems, including Raspberry Pi, use the following commands:

```sh
~/opt/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/3.19.1-1.1/.content/bin/cmake --version

cmake version 3.19.1

CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
