The [xPack CMake](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/cmake-xpack/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[CMake](https://cmake.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86),
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.15** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 12 or later, Debian 8 or later, RedHat/CentOS 7 later,
  Fedora 20 or later, etc)
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.23** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 16 or later, Debian 9 or later, RedHat/CentOS 8 or later,
  Fedora 24 or later, etc)
- x86/x64 Windows: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10
- x64 macOS: 10.13 or later

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/cmake@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack CMake** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The **xPack CMake** is based on the official
[CMake](https://cmake.org), with minimal changes.

The current version is based on:

- CMake release
[3.20.6](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/tag/v3.20.6/)
from Sep 20, 2021.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream version, the Windows version also supports
spawning scripts via `cmd.exe /c`. These scripts are used by **npm**/**xpm**
to redirect invocations to the central packages repository.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- none

## Documentation

The current version specific CMake documentation is available in each packet:

- `doc/cmake-X.Y/html/index.html`

and online from:

- https://cmake.org/documentation/

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/builds/)

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows will most probably
be dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 will most probably be dropped in 2022, and the
minimum requirement will be raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18 and RedHat 8.
