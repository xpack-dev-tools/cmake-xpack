The [xPack CMake](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/cmake-xpack/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[CMake](https://cmake.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64 and arm64)
and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

<Prerequisites/>

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/cmake@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack CMake** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The **xPack CMake** is based on the official
[CMake](https://cmake.org), with no changes.

The current version is based on:

- CMake release
[{frontMatter.upstream_version}](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/tag/v{frontMatter.upstream_version}/) from {frontMatter.upstream_release_date}.

## Changes

- none

:::tip

Starting with mid-2024 (v3.28.6-1), the patch to spawn processes on Windows via `cmd.exe /c` was no longer applied. The direct consequence is that applications started via `.cmd` shim need to declare the `.cmd` extension explicitly (like `ninja.cmd`).

## Documentation

The current CMake documentation is available online from:

- https://cmake.org/documentation/

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/builds/)
