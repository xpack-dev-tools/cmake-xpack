### Check the latest upstream release

The latest release must be announced in
CMake [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/).

Compare the latest upstream release with the current xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/cmake-xpack/releases).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
as below.

As a rule of thumb, when the upstream **{versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()+1}.4** is
released, it is time for the **{versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.X** xPack release
(where X is the latest patch available at that time).
