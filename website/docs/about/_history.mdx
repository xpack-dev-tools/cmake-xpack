The project was created in **April 2020**.

Initially it was considered that on Windows it is mandatory to
spawn processes via `cmd.exe /c` and a patch was applied for this
change. The decision was reversed in mid-2024.

### September 2024

The patch to spawn processes on Windows via `cmd.exe /c` was no longer applied
(in [v3.28.6-1](/blog/2024/09/13/cmake-v3-28-6-1-released/)).

The direct consequence is that applications started via `.cmd` shim need to declare the `.cmd` extension explicitly (like `ninja.cmd`).
