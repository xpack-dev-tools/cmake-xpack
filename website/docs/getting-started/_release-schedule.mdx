## Release schedule

This distribution generally follows the official
CMake [releases](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases),
but usually is one minor release behind (sometimes two).

Deciding when to make new xPack CMake releases is difficult,
because CMake continues to fix issues for the last two minor
releases, and there is no way to tell if a patch release is
the final one.

In practical terms, based on past release schedule,
when the new upstream **{versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()+1}.4** is released,
the previous **{versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.X**
is probably no longer updated and can be released
(where X is the latest patch available at that time).
